# Fignya

A bit like Figma.

Fignya is an opinionated React Component Library generator.

## Get started
`npx fignya init my-library`  

This command creates a component library project in `./my-library` path.

Then  
`cd my-library`  
`npm i`  
`npm start`

## Creating components
`npx fignya component new-component`

## Build the library SDK
`npm run build`
